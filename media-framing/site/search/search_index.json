This project identifies the tone used to report the 2024 U.S. elections in the Wall Street Journal. It is important to examine how the media report relevant events such as elections. Electorates form their judgments about an election based on the information received from the media. Therefore, the overarching question guiding this project is: \"How does the media frame the U.S. Elections?\"</p>"},{"location":"#for-full-documentation-visit-mkdocsorg","title":"For full documentation visit mkdocs.org.","text":""},{"location":"#commands","title":"Commands","text":"<ul> <li><code>mkdocs new [dir-name]</code> - Create a new project.</li> <li><code>mkdocs serve</code> - Start the live-reloading docs server.</li> <li><code>mkdocs build</code> - Build the documentation site.</li> <li><code>mkdocs -h</code> - Print help message and exit.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#project-layout","title":"Project layout","text":"<pre><code>mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.\ndocs/\n    index.md  # The documentation homepage.\n    ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"data/","title":"Data","text":"<p>This part of the media framing  project documentation contains the saved data derived from running the abovementioned scripts in the workflow. For example, the headlines.txt is derived whenever the scrape_headlines.py script is run. This .txt file will aggregate all the headlines on the website at that given time. Hence, it is important to highlight that .txt is a fluid file, and it is bound to change depending on when the scraping process takes place. Also, this is likely to impact the output throughout the process.
