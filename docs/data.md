This part of the media framing  project documentation contains the saved data derived from running the abovementioned scripts in the workflow. For example, the headlines.txt is derived whenever the scrape_headlines.py script is run. This .txt file will aggregate all the headlines on the website at that given time. Hence, it is important to highlight that .txt is a fluid file, and it is bound to change depending on when the scraping process takes place. Also, this is likely to impact the output throughout the process. Other data files include analysis_results.csv,lda_model_20topics.model, and processed_headlines.txt.
